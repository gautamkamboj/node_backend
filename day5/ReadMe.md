# Random Jokes and Images API

## Overview

This Node.js application provides a RESTful API to fetch random jokes and images. It uses the Express.js framework to handle routes and Axios to fetch data from third-party APIs. The application serves static content and can be tested using tools like Postman or a web browser.

## Objectives

- Understand the basics of backend development with Node.js.
- Explore the Express.js framework for building web applications and APIs.
- Implement RESTful routes to handle different types of requests.
- Generate random data and integrate it into an API response.
- Test API endpoints using tools like Postman or a web browser.

## Project Structure

```
random-jokes-images-api/
│
├── index.js
└── public/
    └── index.html
```

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-jokes-images-api.git
   cd random-jokes-images-api
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install express axios
   ```

## Creating the Server

### `index.js`

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Rest of the server setup code...
```

## HTML File

### `public/index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Random Joke and Image</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- HTML content -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Running the Server

1. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

2. **Open your browser**
   Go to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the `index.html` content displaying a joke and an image.

## How to Use the `index.html` File

1. **Ensure the server is running**
   - Start the server using the command `node index.js`.

2. **Navigate to the HTML page**
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`.

3. **View the Random Joke and Image**
   - The `index.html` page will load, and you will see a randomly fetched joke and image displayed on the page.

## Testing the API

Use Postman or any HTTP client to test the API endpoints:

1. **Make a GET request to** `http://localhost:3000/api/image`.
   - Verify that it returns a random image.

2. **Make a GET request to** `http://localhost:3000/api/jokes-images`.
   - Verify that it returns a random joke and a base64 encoded image.

### Example Response

```json
{
    "joke": {
        "id": 123,
        "type": "general",
        "setup": "Why did the scarecrow win an award?",
        "punchline": "Because he was outstanding in his field!"
    },
    "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
}
```

## Challenges Faced

- **Handling Image Data**: Converting image data to base64 format and ensuring proper display in the browser was challenging.
- **Error Handling**: Managing errors from third-party API requests and providing meaningful responses to the client required careful implementation.

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic yet practical introduction to backend development with Node.js and Express.js, demonstrating how to build and test RESTful APIs that integrate multiple data sources. Through this assignment, students gain hands-on experience in handling HTTP requests, generating dynamic content, and delivering it via API endpoints.
